        "Chaturanga: The Ancient Game of Kings\n\n" +
        "Origins\n\n" +
        "Chaturanga (चतुरंग) literally means 'having four limbs' — referring to the four key divisions of an ancient Indian army:\n\n" +
        "• Ratha — Chariots\n" +
        "• Gaja — Elephants\n" +
        "• Ashva — Cavalry (horses)\n" +
        "• Padati — Infantry (foot soldiers)\n\n" +
        "Historical Timeline\n\n" +
        "6th Century CE, Northern India — earliest references appear in Sanskrit literature, especially Subandhu's Vasavadatta and Bāṇabhaṭṭa's Harsha-charita.\n\n" +
        "7th Century CE — Emperor Harsha's court mentions the game as an intellectual pastime among nobles and scholars.\n\n" +
        "8th–9th Century — spreads to Persia, where it becomes Shatranj (2-player version).\n\n" +
        "9th–10th Century — Arabic scholars record it in Baghdad libraries.\n\n" +
        "12th–15th Century — European adaptation begins → modern chess.\n\n" +
        "Cultural Meaning\n\n" +
        "Chaturanga wasn't just a game — it was a war simulation, designed to reflect:\n" +
        "• Military balance (four divisions)\n" +
        "• Diplomacy (alliances)\n" +
        "• Fate (dice)\n" +
        "• Strategy (piece movement and positioning)\n\n" +
        "It taught tactical thinking, patience, and the role of chance — like a philosophical lesson disguised as a board game.\n\n" +
        "Symbolic Interpretation\n\n" +
        "Each division of the army was said to represent an aspect of the human psyche:\n" +
        "• Ratha (Chariot) — strategy, direction\n" +
        "• Gaja (Elephant) — strength, patience\n" +
        "• Ashva (Horse) — speed, intuition\n" +
        "• Padati (Foot Soldiers) — discipline, persistence\n" +
        "• Raja (King) — the self or consciousness\n\n" +
        "Evolution to Modern Chess\n\n" +
        "Chaturanga evolved through Persian Shatranj into the modern game of chess that we know today, spreading across the world and becoming one of the most beloved strategy games in history.";

        "How to Play Chaturanga\n\n" +
        "Game Setup\n\n" +
        "In 4-player Chaturanga, four kingdoms (South, West, North, East) compete on an 8×8 board. Each player starts from a corner with:\n" +
        "• 1 Raja (King)\n" +
        "• 1 Ratha (Chariot)\n" +
        "• 1 Gaja (Elephant)\n" +
        "• 1 Ashva (Horse)\n" +
        "• 4 Padati (Pawns)\n\n" +
        "Alliances\n\n" +
        "Opposite players are allies:\n" +
        "• South + North\n" +
        "• East + West\n\n" +
        "However, if your ally's king is captured, you continue alone!\n\n" +
        "Dice Mode\n\n" +
        "In dice-based gameplay:\n" +
        "1. Roll the dice (1-4)\n" +
        "2. The number determines which piece type you can move:\n" +
        "   • 1 = Raja (King)\n" +
        "   • 2 = Ratha (Chariot)\n" +
        "   • 3 = Gaja (Elephant)\n" +
        "   • 4 = Ashva (Horse)\n" +
        "3. If no piece of that type can move, your turn is skipped\n\n" +
        "Piece Movements\n\n" +
        "• Raja (King): Moves 1 square in any direction\n" +
        "• Ratha (Chariot): Moves any distance horizontally or vertically\n" +
        "• Gaja (Elephant): Jumps exactly 2 squares diagonally\n" +
        "• Ashva (Horse): Moves in an L-shape (like chess knight)\n" +
        "• Padati (Pawn): Moves 1 square forward, captures diagonally\n\n" +
        "Winning\n\n" +
        "Win by:\n" +
        "• Capturing all enemy kings\n" +
        "• Being the last king standing\n" +
        "• Your alliance surviving (if playing with alliances)\n\n" +
        "You lose if:\n" +
        "• Your king is captured\n" +
        "• You have no legal moves\n\n" +
        "Good luck, and may wisdom guide your moves!";
